# Use LLM Using CLI or WEB-UI

## Overview

This project provides two methods to generate text responses:
- A Flask-based web service.
- A CLI-based (non-Flask) application.

Both methods can use either the Transformers library with Hugging Face models or Llama (via `llama_cpp`).

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7 or higher**: Ensure that you have Python installed. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Virtual Environment (recommended)**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

3. **API Keys/Access**: Ensure you have the necessary API keys or access tokens for the Llama model if using it.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file or use the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install flask python-dotenv transformers torch llama_cpp
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the required environment variables. Example `.env` file:

```
MODEL_NAME=gpt2
LLAMA_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/llama/model
MAX_TOKENS=256
TEMPERATURE=0.7
TOP_P=0.95
TOP_K=50
REPETITION_PENALTY=1.2
NO_REPEAT_NGRAM_SIZE=4
NUM_BEAMS=1
BATCH_SIZE=128
```

**Note:** Adjust `LLAMA_MODEL_PATH` to point to your Llama model. If using the Transformers model, `LLAMA_MODEL_PATH` is not needed.

### 5. Ensure Model and Tokenizer Files

- **Transformers**: Ensure you have internet access or the models are available locally.
- **Llama**: Ensure the model file is available at the specified path.

## Running the Application

### 1. Launch the Flask Application

To start the Flask server, use:

```bash
python llama-direct-llm.py
```

Replace `llama-direct-llm.py` with the appropriate script name if necessary.

### 2. Access the CLI Application

To interact via CLI, run:

```bash
python llama-direct-llm-c.py
```

**Example CLI Usage:**

```bash
> provide java code that generates 10 random numbers.
```

**Example Response:**

```bash
import java.util.Random;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Random rand = new Random();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            int randomNum = rand.nextInt((100 - 1) + 1) + 1;
            System.out.println("Random number " + (i + 1) + " : " + randomNum);
        }
    }
}

// Here we are creating a Java program that generates 10 random numbers between 1 and 100. 
// The "rand.nextInt((100 - 1) + 1) + 1" part of the code is used to generate the random numbers. 
// The numbers generated are from the range 1 to 100 (inclusive).
// "nextInt((100 - 1) + 1)" generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) to 100 (inclusive). Adding 1 shifts that range to 1 to 100.
```

### 3. Access the Web Service

By default, the Flask app will run on `http://127.0.0.1:9898`. You can send a POST request to the `/generate` endpoint with a JSON payload:

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9898/generate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt": "Tell me a joke."}'
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "response": "Here is a joke: Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field!"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in the `.env` file.
- **Model Loading Issues**: Verify model paths and configurations are correct.
- **Dependency Issues**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and compatible with your Python version.
